# A Tic-Tac-Toe API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mrfishball/TicTacToeRubyRails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mrfishball/TicTacToeRubyRails)

It is used to implement your very own Tic-Tac-Toe game on virtually any platform of your choice.

Development
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Ruby, version 2.5.1 or newer**
 - **Bundler** â€” If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.  
2. cd into the repo you just cloned.
4. Initialize and start TicTacToeRubyRails.

```shell
# run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec rails s
```
The API is now live at http://localhost:3000. Whoa! That was fast!

### Testing with Rspec

```shell
# run this to run tests
bundle exec rails spec
```
